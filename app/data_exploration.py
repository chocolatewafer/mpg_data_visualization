We can see from this chart that most Cars are **4, 6** or **8** cylinders. This might be due to even numbers of cylinders providing better manufacturing cost, efficiency or performance, due to which car manufacturers choose this configuration.

It turns out engines with odd configurations are rather unstable and have vibrations, making even configurations preferable for balance and smoothness.

What we can also observe is that we have higher number of 4 cylinder cars in our data. One hypothesis might be that 4 cylinder cars are more fuel efficient. On the contrary it can also be that while 6 and 8 are more fuel efficient, they might be more expensive and hence less sought ought by average buyers.

One final consideration to this line of thinking should be that the data collection might be uneven, giving us this particular distribution of cars; making both of our hypothesis completely invalid.

From these two graphs we can have some insights as to how:
- **4 cylinder** cars have lower horsepower but are more fuel efficient.
- **6 cylinder** cars seems to have a balanced horsepower and fuel consumption.
-  On the contrary, **8 cylinder** cars have greater horsepower but are quite fuel hungry in general.

All this seems to be in line with the hypothesis that the 3 and 5 cylinder engines are not very performant, giving relatively low horsepower over average fuel efficiency. The **4 cylinder** cars seem to have a good balance between horsepower and miles per gallon.

### Spread and Outliers

There is a varied mpg and horsepower observed in 8 cylinder cars meaning there are a regular cars and then there are muscle cars giving a greater range of mpgs and horsepowers.

There are some outliers is both mpg and horsepower graphs.

### Muscle Cars
The 6 cylinder **buick regal sport coupe (turbo)** is a muscle car giving a very high horsepower and comes in line with other average 8 cylinder cars. Similarly the 230hp **pontiac grand prix** is a 8 cylinder beast of a muscle car which explains the very high horsepower.

### Efficient Cars
There are certain economy or diesel version of cars that make them exceptionally fuel efficient like the 6 cylinder **oldsmobile cutlass ciera (diesel)** or the 8 cylinder **oldsmobile cutlass ls**


To get a more complete picture, we need to perform further analysis. Let us hence try to gather more insights from our data regarding engine performance with respect to number of cylinders, displacement, weight and country of origin.

# ### Observations: Cylinders vs others
# We can see that more number of **cylinder** means higher **horse power**, more **displacement** and also a **heavier engine**.
#
# There is no clear relationship between the model year and the number of cylinders, indicating that cars with varying engine types were produced across all years.
#
# Checking out the **4 cylinder** engines, we observe that they give great fuel efficiency with light engines but with lower horse power. This could also mean they are both cheaper to manufacture and to use. This could explain why there are greater number of cars with 4 cylinder engines produced.
#
# We can not however, say for sure that these 4 cylinder cars are the most poular or most bought cars though. For that, we would need the sales data of these models to be certain.
#
# **6 cylinder engines** have a good balance of efficiency and horsepower. **8 cylinder engines** pack a punch with higher horsepower but guzzle a lot of fuel. The **8 cylinder** engines are some of the most powerful engines with very high horsepower. This makes sense as more cylinders will displace more fuel, producing more power but meaning lower fuel efficiency. At the same time bigger and heavier engines are needed to accomodate more number of cylinders.

# ### Observation: horsepower vs others & displacement vs others
# We can see the relationships between weight, displacement and horsepower, i.e
#
# **more displacement &rarr; more horsepower**
#
# **more displacement &rarr; more weight**
#
# meaning **higher horsepower** engines are **heavier** like we observed before.
#
# The relationshoip between acceleration and displacement and acceleration and horsepower is negatively proportional though. This is rather counter intuitive as you might think cars having higher horsepower/displacement should provide higher acceleration as well. But that is not the case at all.
#
# What we can also see is that newer models have lower horsepower.
#
# To make more sense out of this we can create a correlation heatmap and perform further multivariate analysis.


# ## CORRELATION HEATMAP


correlation = mpg_data.select_dtypes("number").corr("pearson")
correlation


px.imshow(correlation, text_auto=True, color_continuous_scale="thermal", aspect="auto")


# The correlation heatmaps confirms the relation between **cylinder, displacement, horsepower and weight.**
# We also see that these affect mpg negatively as expected.
#
# We can also see that there is a fair relationship between mpg and model years, meaning newer models tend to be fuel efficient.
#
# But then acceleration is negatively proportional to cylinder, displacement, horsepower and weight, which is still unexplained.
# Whats more, there is a weakly positive relation between acceleration and mpg meaning higher acceleration gives better mileage, which is not logical.


px.scatter(data_frame=mpg_data, x="horsepower", y="mpg", color="model_year")


# From this plot we can confirm that newer models are more efficient than the older ones. However, we can see that the newer models also have lower horsepower.


px.scatter(data_frame=mpg_data, x="weight", y="horsepower", color="model_year")


# With this graph we find that heavier models are all older models, which also have a lot of horse power. The newer models are not only fuel efficient but are lighter and provide lower power output.
#
# This raises a questions as why the companies would build such cars with low power and weight but better fuel efficiency?


px.scatter(data_frame=mpg_data, x="horsepower", y="acceleration", color="model_year")


# This tells us almost all new models have low horse power but high acceleration. Even though there were some older models that had low horsepower/high acceleration.


px.scatter(
    data_frame=mpg_data,
    x="weight",
    y="acceleration",
    color="horsepower",
    color_continuous_scale="temps",
)


# Higher horsepower cars are almost always rather heavy with lower acceleration.


cyl = (
    mpg_data.groupby("model_year")
    .aggregate(avg_no_of_cylinders=("cylinders", "mean"), avg_mpg=("mpg", "mean"))
    .reset_index()
)
px.scatter(data_frame=cyl, x="model_year", y="avg_no_of_cylinders", color="avg_mpg")


# Newer cars have fewer no of cylinders on average.


# These final graphs give us answers to a few questions we were asking.
#
# # Conclusions
#
# ## Why would acceleration increase when horsepower is decreasing?
#
# Newer cars have higher acceleration despite lower horsepower. And along with good acceleration, these cars are also fuel efficient.
#
# Turns out the acceleration in cars are increasing beacuse cars are getting lighter, requiring less power to accelerate.
#
#
# ## Why did the companies start making lower power, fuel efficient cars?
#
#  This data does make it clear that cars do not only need raw horsepower. They can be fast and fuel efficient even with lower horsepower. With fuel emmisions being a major concern and major technological breakthroughs, it is compeletely sensible now that the companies chose to make their cars this way. What is more that the cars could be cheaper with less materials being used and the car would be less expensive to operate for the customers as well all while being better for the environment.
#
# There might be several factors that the data does not capture. The newer cars would have better technology like lighter materials, aerodynamics, better fuel composition and better engineering as well. But the fact is that car companies did make lighter, fuel efficient cars earlier too; only that they chose to keep making newer cars that were lower power and less fuel hungry.
#
# ## Why are there so many 4 cylinder cars?
#
# This falls in line with the fact that the newer models have on average lower number of cylinders. This also makes us understand as why there are more number of 4 cylinder cars which are the lightest and most fuel efficient, with better stability, lower vibration and possibly the cost.
#
