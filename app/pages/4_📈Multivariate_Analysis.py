We also see that these affect mpg negatively as expected.

We can also see that there is a fair relationship between mpg and model years, meaning newer models tend to be fuel efficient.

But then acceleration is negatively proportional to cylinder, displacement, horsepower and weight, which is still unexplained.
Whats more, there is a weakly positive relation between acceleration and mpg meaning higher acceleration gives better mileage, which is not logical.

Now for a more better understanding, we can take more than two variables in a graph:
